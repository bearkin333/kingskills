# Bearking's Total Skill Rework
## Skills fit for a King

Did you ever think it was strange that a crazed naked bearded man blocking pebbles with an awkwardly sized lump of wood might gets the same experience for that as a heavily armored champion of midgard skillfully shouldering the literally earth-shattering blow of a twenty foot troll? Or that hitting a tree with a stick is almost exactly as rewarding as valiantly slaying the king of dragons? Did you know that, in the vanilla game, it would take you 27.68 hours of running to hit max level running, and there's no meaningful way to change that number? Did you ever, like me, slash your way through thirty hours of flooded swamps, frost-bitten tundras, and unspeakbly massive forests with nothing but your trusty axe by your side, only to find that you had, by the end of the vanilla game, hit level 34 with your highest skill and you couldn't even tell if it was making a difference?



Worry no longer! King's Skills is a mod that, as it says on the tin, totally reworks both the experience and effects of every base skill in the game. Everything was extensively researched and play-tested to change each skill in the game to be impactful, interesting, and full of meaningful choices.

### Experience changes
First of all, Valheim's experience system is given a total overhaul. The goal was to add certain elements of realism, allowing you to find ways to train your skills in ways that would make sense, while also rewarding you for embodying the gameplay archetypes each skill represents. We use an algorythm to apply a more interesting mechanical curve to your experience gain. Though your first couple of levels may take a little longer to get the hang of, you'll find a mid-levels much easier to speed through, as well as the whole process overall taking less time than vanilla. Also, there is no longer any skill in the game that can't be trained *faster* somehow by making choices that are meaningful to the gameplay style represented by that skill.

The biggest changes were made to weapon experience. You can now get experience with any weapon in four different ways.
You get experience at a slow rate just while holding a weapon, to represent the way you might get more familiar with a tool the longer you spend with it. You also get a small flat amount of experience on every swing, if you'd like to practice your skills in a totally safe environment.

However, if you really want to master a weapon, you're gonna have to do one of two things - damage, or bonus experience.

You now earn experience based on how much damage you do with a weapon swing, meaning that the higher level your weapons are and the more skillfully you play, the more experience you'll gain. Every weapon now has a different way of earning "Bonus Experience", little goals that fit into the weapon's overall build. With clubs, you'll earn Bonus Experience for staggering an enemy with damage, since that's ideally why you'd be using clubs in the first place. For Knives, you get bonus experience for backstabs - that means that, even though a knife-user might spend longer setting up the perfect stealth kills, they wouldn't fall behind a sword-user in terms of experience gain.

### Skill changes
In addition to the new ways to improve your skills, skills are finally incredibly useful and impactful. In vanilla, most skills in the game affect only *1*, maybe 2 factors, and often so imperceptibly that it would take reaching level 40-50 before you even started to really notice (something that, as before mentioned, might take more time than you would even spend in a base vanilla game). In King's Skills, the average number of variables affected by a skill is *5*. In addition to the broader range of changes, skills will now provide more powerful effects. It's finally time to *feel* like a true legendary warrior of Midgard, and be fully rewarded for the time and effort put into training your skills.

The biggest change made is, as with experience, to weapons. Previously, each of the eight different weapon-skills in the game only affected the damage and stamina usage of the weapon, which is a huge wasted opportunity. Now, in addition to weapon damage and stamina cost reduction, every individual weapon has at least 3 weapon-specific bonuses as you level the skill up. Getting a higher level of knives will finally increase your sneak damage multiplier, and increasing your fist skill will increase your overall movespeed. What's more, almost all of those side-effects from skills have **global** effects. Any master of swordplay is naturally going to have an easier time handling and dodging, even when they're using a spear. No skill will become useless now the moment you stop holding the specific weapon it was meant for, and a master of all weapons is going to truly be something to fear. The blasphemous enemies of Odin will learn to fear you!

### Freedom Of Information Act
There's an In-Game GUI that can be accessed by pressing the "I" button which will allow you to view exactly what the conditions are for each skills' new form of experience gain, explicitly how much experience you have, and *exactly* what that skill is currently doing for you.

### Encumberance and Running
This mod adds new penalties to being encumbered. You're now hit by a movement speed malus based on how full your inventory is - a change made to balance out the new and incredibly more powerful run skill. 

Swim and Run experience gain are now both affected by how encumbered you are and how fast you're going. If you absolutely need to level up run as fast as possible, you can load yourself down with heavy bundles of wood and stone and sprint through the woods. You get an experience bonus based on how much absolute weight you're carrying as well as how much you're carrying relative to your maximum movespeed. 

### New Skills
---Still In Progress---

For all the skills in the game, there are still so many actions you can take in the world that vanilla won't notice. Now you can finally have the game recognize and reward you for your hours of painstakingly constructing huge cathedrals, or tending to the fields. Every battle is won by grain before it is won by swords.
Adds Sailing, Construction, Cooking, Gathering, and Mining

### Perks
---Still In Progress---

As you hit significant skill milestones, like level 50 or 100, you will now get to make choices between big bonuses that will seriously affect the way you interact with that skill or the world. Manage to get Jump up to level 50, and suddenly you'll be able to perform special meteor drops that turn your downward velocity into ground and enemy-destroying shockwaves. Perform the incredible feat of levelling woodcutting to 100, and you'll suddenly be able to fell entire forests with a single blow. Every feat is rewarded!

All perks will be hidden at the start of a game. This can be turned off in the configs, but where's your sense of adventure and discovery???

## Warning
**This mod totally reworks how every skill is gained and implemented. Every skill affects almost every part of the game now, even more than before, both massively increasing the range of possible gamestates and massively disrupting the game's base balancing. In addition to making skills overall more powerful and easier to acquire, it changes certain ways that experience is expected to be gained. *

**This means two things. First - despite great pains taken to make this mod compatible, *any other mod that so much as touches the base skills* is probably a bad choice to use with this mod. I would recommend against attempting it. Mods adding other new skills wouldn't be as incompatible, but would still likely be greatly disruptive to the game balance.**

**Second - While the numbers in this mod have been painstakingly balanced and taste-tested, there is still a good chance that the game will become overall easier as a result. I'd recommend finding a way to make enemies tougher or scale harder. I have plans to make a companion difficulty mod, but it's not that high on my priority list.**

**Almost every number and ability in this mod can be changed or toggled on or off in the config files, but don't do this unless you've spent a lot of time reflecting on the ramifications of doing so, and have consulted your local psychiatrist or exorcist first**




# Total Change List
#### Axes
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience for the axe is gained every time you break a log.

Since axes don't offer many bonuses compared to other weapons, its main gameplay style is actually based around the fact that it can be used for woodcutting and vice versa. Because of this, levelling up axe gains you the following bonuses - axe damage, axe stamina reduction, carrying capacity, tree damage, and base stamina.

#### Blocking
Now, block experience is based on how much damage you blocked, using a similar formula to weapon experience. The number is unaffected by your resistance to damage types. You also get double experience for blocks that are perfect parries.

Levelling up blocking now reduces the stamina cost for blocking, gives you extra % block armor, extra flat block armor, and extra max health.

#### Bows
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience is gained based on the length and difficulty of successful shots with a bow.

Compared to other weapon skills, bows were already sort of kitted out with a decent number of effects, so less has actually been changed. Still, to bring them to rear with other weapon skills, we added some nice utilities. Levelling up bows now gives you the following - extra bow damage, stamina reduction with bows, extra velocity on your arrows, extra draw speed, and extra loot drops from huntable creatures, like boars and deer.

#### Clubs
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience every time you stagger an enemy with damage with a club.

Clubs are a much more defensive, debuff-focused weapon. Aside from being one of the only two weapons that includes AOE damage, it also focuses primarily on staggering enemies via physical, blunt damage. Levelling up clubs now gives you the following - extra club damage, stamina reduction with clubs, extra bonus to ALL blunt damage, knockback bonus to ALL weapons, and extra stagger damage with ALL attacks.

#### Fists
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP. You gain hold experience for fists much slower than other weapons, since being "unarmed" isn't much of a choice.

Bonus experence for fists is gained every time you perform an unarmed block.

Fists exist in a very weird space in the game right now. Not really designed to be its own form of combat, but rather a fallback when you're out of other options, this mod hopes to make being a "monk" a more viable option, if not quite as strong as other weapon-based combat. Levelling up unarmed now gives you extra fist damage, extra FLAT fist damage, stamina reduction with fists, extra flat unarmed block armor, and an overall increase to movespeed.

#### Jump
Now, whenever you jump, you get extra experience based on how high the jump was or how long you stayed in the air. Technically, it's based on how much damage you would've taken from the fall before any fall damage reduction.

Levelling up jump now increases your forward jump force and upward jump force, decreases the stamina cost to jump, lowers the minus to jump when jumping without stamina, reduces the overall damage you take from falling, and increases the height you can fall from before the game starts calculating fall damage.

#### Knives
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience is gained every time you perform a sneak attack with a knife.

Knives are very self-evidently a stealth focused build, but underperform when compared to bows and compared to other similar weapons. These changes are designed to make the sneaky assassin build just as viable as any other type of combat. Levelling up knives gives you extra damage with knives, reduced stamina usage with knives, a bonus to all sneak attack damage, a bonus to move speed, and a bonus to ALL piercing damage.

#### Mining
Like weapons, mining experience is now gained based from the amount of damage dealt to resources. You also get a reduced rate of experience from just hitting the floor.

In addition, levelling up mining now increases the damage you deal to rocks more, but also increases your drop rates from ores spots, and gives you a stamina rebate on every swing that hits a rock.

#### Polearms
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience for polearms is not implemented yet.

Polearms are perhaps the weirdest weapon currently in the game. There are only three polearms in the base game, and they don't have much of an identity outside of being large, slow, and being the only weapon with a reliable source of AOE. Now, levelling up polearms increases polearm damage, reduces stamina costs with polearms, increases the range of ALL weapons by a flat amount, gives you a flat amount of armor at ALL times, and also increases your block armor when blocking with a polearm.

#### Run
The faster you're moving, the more experience you get. The closer your get to fully encumbered, the slower you move. You more you're carrying, the more experience you get.

Levelling up run gives you additional run speed, a reduction to the move speed penality from your equipment, a reduction to the move speed penality from your encumberance, a reduction in stamina costs, and a bonus to your base stamina.

#### Spears
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience anytime you hit an enemy with a thrown weapon.

Spears are largely one handed throwing weapons, and are often worn with shields. I decided to take the spear build as basically the idea of a heavily armored, shield-focused valkyrie, as well as providing some great benefits to thrown weapons. Levelling up spear now grants you extra spear damage, reduced stamina with spears, extra throwing weapon velocity, extra damage with throwing weapons, and an increased flat block armor at all times.

#### Sneak
Sneak is about the only skill that doesn't need much in the way of changes. Base sneak already had a number of interesting and varied effects, and was probably one of the best designed skills in base game. However, to bring it up to the level of all my skill changes, there are still things I felt I could do.

Normally, you gain experience with stealth at a pretty rapid pace while you're within sight range of an enemy, but not detected. With this mod, you also gain a bonus to experience gain based on how dangerous the enemy you're evading is.

Levelling up stealth now increases the speed you move while sneaking, reduces the stamina costs, and increases your "stealth factor", which is how much you reduce an enemy's sight range while sneaking.

#### Swim
Swim follows the same encumberance rules as run. In vanilla, the ONLY thing levelling up swim did was decreased the stamina cost of swimming. Now, You get extra swim speed, swim acceleration, turn speed in water, and reduced stamina cost. Since swimming is pretty underutilized, these numbers are all tuned pretty high. You could theoretically go faster in water than on land with a high enough swim skil.

#### Swords
Added 4 weapon experience types: Hold, Swing, Damage, and Bonus EXP.

Bonus experience is gained every time you deal damage to a staggered enemy with a sword.

Swords are one of the quicker, better balanced weapons in the game. They're also sort of designed to be one of the more skillful playstyles, based on parrying enemies and dealing your damage during their forced stagger animations. Because of this, when levelling up swords, you get extra sword damage, reduced stamina reduction, high parry bonus to ALL weapons and shields, extra slashing damage with ALL weapons, and a reduced cost to the dodge roll.

#### Woodcutting
Like weapons, woodcutting experience is now gained based from the amount of damage dealt to resources.
In addition, levelling up woodcutting now increases the damage you deal to trees more, but also increases your drop rates from trees, and gives you a stamina rebate on every swing that hits a tree.
