## Bearking's Total Skill Rework
# Skills fit for a King

Did you ever think it was weird that a crazed bearded man dressed in rags, wildly swinging around a stick with a rock glued to it gets the same experience for each swing as a steel-laden defender of midgard with a perfectly balanced six foot head-chopper? Did you ever slash your way through thirty hours of flooded swamps, frost-bitten tundras, and unspeakbly massive forests with nothing but your trusty blade by your side, only to pull up the skill screen and find out that you're only level 30, and you can barely even tell if your levels are making a difference?

Well worry no longer! King's skills is a total skill rework that adds several new skills and reworks nearly every existing skill to be more immersive, more interesting to train, and more impactful on your play experience. 

Wanna get fast? Easy! Load yourself up with rocks, and pull a heavy cart through a swamp in full plate. The more you carry, the faster you gain running experience. That's how we do it on earth!

Wanna study the blade while your friends are all smoking and partying? Now, you get more familiar just HOLDING the sword - and you can practice swing all night in preparation! But nothing beats the thrilling experience you gain from real combat, where you get more experience based on how much damage you do.

So now you can level up your skills - but what fun would that be if not for the fabulous prizes? Most skills now give you buffs in several different areas as they level up. Every single weapon skill now gives you different bonuses that make sense for the play style - enjoy a bonus to stagger damage with the club, or bonus backstab damage with the dagger - that carries over to other weapons. A knife master will find their footing handling a sword a little easier, and a true master of all weapons will become a force to be reckoned with.

As you level up with each skill, you will gain Perks, which are powerful buffs and abilities that truly signify your mastery of the craft. Perks are hidden until you unlock them (which can be turned off in the config menu), so get out there and get exploring!
King skills also adds several new skills so that no matter how to end up spending your time in midgard, you can feel truly rewarded for a job well done.
